## Usage

To gather system details, create and run a shell script on your source server by following these steps:

1. Create a shell script using any text editor:

```
sudo vi system_details_parse.sh
```

2. Copy the content of the script to the file `system_details_parse.sh`

**Note**: You can directly download the script by using the command below:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/mgn-drs-linux-system-details-tool/refs/heads/main/system_details_parse.sh
```

3. Change the permission of the script:

```
sudo chmod +x system_details_parse.sh
```

4. Execute the script:

```
sudo ./system_details_parse.sh
```

## Sample Output

After running the script, you will receive the following output:
